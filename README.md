## Lab 1 - Supervised Learning
The goal of this lab was to evaluate the performance of different supervised machine learning algorithms on two datasets taken by [UCI Machine Learning repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php) after data pre-processing and hyperparameter tuning.  

## Lab 2 - Unsupervised Learning
The goal of this lab was to develop a movie recommender system with content-based filtering, focusing on the corpuses of the movies. Then we use [Somoclu's](http://somoclu.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html) library to create Self Organizing Maps (SOM) and cluster our movies based on their genres. For this lab we use a subset of the [Carnegie Mellon Movie Summary Corpus](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~ark/personas/) dataset.
