# Unsupervised learning


## Dataset

We were given a subset of [Carnegie Mellon Movie Summary Corpus](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~ark/personas/), that contains 42,306 movie plot summaries extracted from Wikipedia and aligned metadata extracted from Freebase, including the movie title, one or more labels about to genre and a short summary. 


## Movie recommendation system based on the content

In the first part, we implement a content based recommendation system for movies. The purpose of this system is to recommend movies that might interest the user, using content-based filtering method. First, we convert each summary in a tf-idf vector representation and, then, we recomment to the user movies that have similar representation (accoding to cosine similarity) with those movies that he have already seen.


### Pre-processing methods used:

- Removing punctuation
- Removing names
- Stemming

### Tf-idf vectorizer parameters used:

- Removing stop words
- Removing words with high df (document frequency)
- Removing word with low df
- Use bigrams along with unigrams

## Somoclu - Self Organizing MapsÂ¶

In the second part, we rely on the topological properties of the Self Organizing Maps (SOM) in order to create a 2-dimensional grid in which we project the movies of our dataset based on their content but most importantly their genre.

### Results

- U-matrix of best model



- Distribution of categories in some clusters of best model
