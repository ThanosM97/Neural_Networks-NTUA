For this lab exercise we were given two datasets taken by UCI Machine Learning Repository. The goal of the exercise was to apply different pre-processing techniques and tune the hyperparameters of the machine learning algorithms, using the 10-fold cross validation method with grid search, in order to evaluate the performance of these algorithms on the dataset. 

## LSVT Voice Rehabilitation Data Set
The first dataset we examined is the [LSVT Voice Rehabilitation Data Set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/LSVT+Voice+Rehabilitation). It contains data produced via signal processing of the participants voice in order to assess whether voice rehabilitation treatment lead to phonations considered 'acceptable' or 'unacceptable'.
